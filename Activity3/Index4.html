        <h3>1996–2005: Hip-hop roots, early success and first generation K-pop</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In March 1996, Yang Hyun-suk, a former member of the first-generation K-pop group Seo Taiji and Boys,
            founded YG Entertainment along with his younger brother Yang Min-suk.[7][9] The company's first artist was
            the hip-hop trio Keep Six. When they failed to attract popularity, Yang turned his focus to the duo Jinusean
            and in 1998 to the debut of 1TYM. Both were successful artists that Yang credits for bringing YG and the hip
            hop genre into mainstream Korean music.<br><br>

            In 1999, YG's artists released a collaborative album under the name YG Family. The label followed with releases
            from artists such as Perry, Swi.T, Big Mama, Lexy, Gummy and Wheesung. It also established the "YG Underground" label,
            which housed 45RPM and Stony Skunk. In 2001, a second YG Family album was released. Among others, it featured the 13-year-old
            G-Dragon, who was then a trainee.<br><br>
            
            The agency found success in both Korea and Japan with its first "idol" singer Seven in 2003,
            who became the company's first artist to attempt to cross over into the US music scene, though his US debut failed to
            gain momentum.<br><br>

        <h3>2006–2011: Mainstream breakthrough</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Following Se7en's success, YG formed its first idol group Big Bang in 2006. Despite an initial lukewarm reception,
            the group's breakthrough the following year and their consistent popularity have made them one of the biggest and
            most bankable boy bands in the world.[14] This was followed by YG's first successful girl group 2NE1 in 2009,
            who prior to their split in 2016, were considered one of the most successful and popular girl groups in South Korea.
            Similarly to Seven, both groups conducted successful careers in Japan.<br><br>
            
            2NE1 debuted in 2009 as the first major girl group under YG and became the first group to achieve nine number-one
            songs on the Gaon Digital Chart.<br><br>
            
            In 2010, YG made a highly publicized move into a new building, while the old headquarters became a training facility.
            In the same year, the company unsuccessfully applied for listing on the stock exchange; it was suspected that this was
            because the company had too few active music groups and an unstable cash flow, despite an increase in earnings in 2009.
            Later that year, the label signed established artist Psy.<br><br>
