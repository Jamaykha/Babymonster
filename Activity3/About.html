    <i><h1>BABYMONSTER (베이비몬스터)</h1></i>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>also known as <b><u>Baemon</u></b>, is an pre-debut South Korean girl group under YG Entertainment.
        They are set to debut in the 2nd quarter of 2023. 
        They released their pre-debut single <b><u>‘DREAM‘</u></b> on May 14, 2023.
        Following the debuts of YG Entertainment's representative girl groups, 2NE1 (2009) and Blackpink (2016),
        speculation about the label's next girl group began in 2018. The company received applications from all over the world,
        and some were accepted into its training program as young as the age of ten, training for an average of four to five years.
        Each prospective member placed first out of thousands of recruits in their respective auditions. In January 2020,
        the label trademarked in English and Korean the written forms of "BabyMonster," one of many names considered for Blackpink,
        and <b><u>"Baemon"</u></b> (a syllabic abbreviation of the former), which were tentatively used by media outlets until the eventual
        disclosure of their official uses. Last Evaluation (2023), a reality show filmed a year before its airing and featuring seven potential members,
        documented the group's selection process. Yang Hyun-suk, the founder of YG Entertainment, enlisted the help of AKMU's Lee Su-hyun and Winner's Kang Seung-yoon and Lee Seung-hoon,
        among others, to judge, rank, and determine the show's formation. Yang revealed that the original plan was for five members; however, a seven-piece ensemble was finalized with three
        South Koreans (Ahyeon, Haram, and Rora), two Japanese (Ruka and Asa), and two Thai members (Pharita and Chiquita). The label chose Ahyeon, Ruka, Chiquita, Haram, and Pharita, while Rora
        and Asa were considered for two separate projects before joining the final line-up as "fans' choice." </p>
